# 📊 A/B Testing Analysis: Facebook vs. Google AdWords Campaign

This project aims to analyze and compare the performance of two ad campaigns — one on **Facebook** and the other on **Google AdWords** — using A/B testing and statistical analysis to determine which platform yields better ROI.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

As a marketing analyst, your goal is to evaluate which advertising platform offers better performance in terms of:
- Click-through rates (CTR)
- Conversion rates
- Cost per click (CPC)
- Return on investment (ROI)

By identifying the more effective platform, we aim to guide marketing budget allocation and strategy optimization.
